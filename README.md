# :: what happened to JMDash⁉️
The development wasn't going great, **at all**. \
For this reason, after a (***n***) month long pause, I was gonna rewrite **JMCompiler** from scratch, but I didn't. \
Instead, I archived the **JMDash** repository, and started writing a whole new syntax system for **JMDash**, which then became **JMdR**. \
So you can think of **JMdR** as a less cluttered, more developer-friendly version of what **JMDash** was gonna be.
